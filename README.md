## Description

This is a full-stack MERN application with full CRUD on the front and back-end, which allows users to plan a ski trip to any one of the twenty-six ski resort locations in California. A user will make an account and choose a ski resort they would like to visit, from there they can create a plan, read it, update it, and delete it if they please. A user can have multiple plans.
